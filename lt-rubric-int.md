|:--- |:----: |:---:|:---: |:----: |:---: |
|Punctuality, planning and process (15%)|Final paper and/or draft were not submitted on time, or intermediate deadlines were otherwise not met on more than one occasion.|The paper and draft were submitted on time, but other intermediate deadlines agreements were not met on one occasion.|The draft and final work were submitted on time and all intermediate deadlines/other agreements that were in place were met. However, moving the project forward required monitoring and troubleshooting by the supervisor.|The submitted draft and final work were submitted in time. The student took a proactive stance towards work that needed to be done and problems that needed to be solved.|The draft and final work were submitted in time. The student was very proactive during the whole process of creating the thesis, foreseeing issues and possible solutions and acting accordingly to solve them ahead of time.|
|Writing (10%)|The grammar and/or spelling in the thesis are not up to standards, or the review lacks clarity and logical flow.|The text is organized acceptably, but many small issues (either spelling, grammar or flow) hinder clarity.|The final paper is organized acceptably, with logical flows and transitions and headings that ease comprehension of the text. Spelling and grammar are of good quality.|The final paper is very well organized. The writing is clear, parsimonious and makes good use of logical flow. Headings are helpful and used consistently.|The final paper is very well organized. The writing is clear, parsimonious and makes good use of logical flow. Headings are helpful and used consistently. Thoughts are articulated very well, leading to highly effective communication.|
|Theoretical framework and problem statement (15%)|There is no clear description of the problem that the thesis tries to address, or context is lacking for understanding the relevance and/or key concepts that are to be explored.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly, but the discussion of background literature to contextualize the problem or operational definitions of key concept are lacking, incomplete or inaccurate.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly and succinctly, and key concepts from the background literature, as well as operational definitions are reviewed to clarify the problem.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly and succinctly, operational definitions are given and the thesis shows integration of a variety of sources to properly contextualize the central problem.|The thesis not only provides clear operational definitions and an integrated theoretical framework that draws on a variety of sources, but also identifies an important problem that warrants the literature research. This problem was stated clearly and succinctly.|
|Critical thinking (20%)|The thesis uncritically summarizes existing literature and/or takes a singular perspective on the topic of the thesis, without addressing the assumptions underlying the cited research.|The thesis critically addresses some research findings, but only minimally examines underlying assumptions and mostly takes a singular perspective.|The thesis critically addresses some of the research findings and examines underlying assumptions, while comparing multiple perspectives on the topic at hand.|The thesis critically addresses the research body under examination and takes a clear position by comparing multiple perspectives and questioning underlying assumptions.|The thesis shifts the thinking of the reader by critically examining the existing literature and taking a well-argued position, based on a comparison between multiple perspectives. This thesis questions underlying assumptions and adds original thought.|
|Content and discussion (20%)|The thesis does not present data/information in a clear manner, is incomplete/inaccurate when interpreting existing research or incoherent in drawing conclusions.|The thesis sets out a coherent line of thought, based on accurate interpretations of existing literature, but leaves out relevant findings.|The thesis sets out a coherent line of thought and gives an accurate interpretation of existing literature, while covering most of the relevant findings. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework.|The thesis follows a coherent line of thought and interpretations of existing research are accurate, and connected so that a persuasive argument follows. No relevant findings are missing, nor are irrelevant findings discussed. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework.|The thesis sets out a coherent line of thought and interprets existing research accurately, while clearly showing the connections between them to make an argument. No relevant findings are missing, nor are irrelevant findings discussed. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework, while also making clear suggestions for future, follow-up research.|
|Interdisciplinary reflection (15%)|The thesis does not address how the research question is relevant to other disciplines or how other disciplines could help provide an answer to the original question -- or it does so only to a very small or poorly substantiated degree.|The question of the thesis is substantially addressed using multiple disciplinary perspectives, or the impact of the research under discussion for other disciplines is argued for persuasively.|The thesis shows how the research question under consideration is relevant to multiple disciplines. The thesis clarifies which insights or approaches from different disciplines can be used to provide an answer to the research question.|The thesis shows how the research question under consideration is relevant to multiple disciplines. The thesis clarifies which insights or approaches from different disciplines can be used to answer the research question and integrates insights to arrive at a (tentative) interdisciplinary answer.|The thesis shows how the research question under consideration is relevant to multiple disciplines. The thesis clarifies which insights or approaches from different disciplines can be used to answer the research question and integrates these insights to arrive at a (tentative) interdisciplinary answer. The thesis explicitizes which different disciplinary insights complement each other, which ones exist at odds which each other and how future research or reasoning might resolve outstanding issues.|
|Academic standards (5%)|Citations are missing or not formatted according to the respective style guide.|Citations and formatting are in order, but writing is not always according to academic standards.|Citations and formatting are complete and correct and writing is mostly in line with academic standards.|Citations and formatting are complete and correct and academic writing is in line with academic standards.|Citations and formatting are complete and correct and academic writing is of the quality you would expect from a paper submitted by a PhD candidate.|

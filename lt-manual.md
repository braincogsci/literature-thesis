# Literature Thesis Manual

## Introduction
The ability to review and synthesize information from a variety of sources is a key skill for academic researchers. The module *Literature Thesis* in the research master Brain and Cognitive Sciences is an opportunity for students to practice and develop the skills that are necessary to give a state-of-the-art overview of existing research, on a topic of the student’s choosing. The *Literature Thesis* should not reflect original research by the student (unless it is already published in a peer-reviewed journal), but instead collect and integrate existing work.

## Content
The student is expected to collect information on a specific subject in a short period, to make a structured summary of this information and to give a critical evaluation of the existing knowledge. A critical evaluation entails that, in addition to classifying known data, the student shows his/her own views on the literature. This could be a consideration of the shortcomings of existing knowledge and a suggestion as to how new understanding might be obtained in the future.


## Size of thesis
All this should be done in eight weeks full time, or 336 hours. The way these hours are spent will differ per discipline and per project. Sometimes the collection of sources will be especially time-consuming, other times the interpretation or comparison of sources will be the lion's share of the work. The supervisor and the student should make sure there is a planning that reflects the time limit and should agree on a word count in advance.

The important thing is that the workload of the thesis equals eight weeks full-time, whether this time is spent on collecting resources, interpreting contradictory results or discussing the implications of the body of research.

## Learning goals
Through the process of writing this thesis the student:
1. Demonstrates a scientific attitude (independence, time management & planning, scientific discussion, creativity, initiative, communication).
2. Demonstrates the ability to write in academic English.
3. Is able to find, select and organize relevant literature from scientific journals.
4. Can formulate a well-structured abstract.
5. Can set out the framework to formulate a (literature research) question.
6. Is able to find, select and organize relevant literature from scientific journals.
7. Is able to critically read and evaluate the selected literature.
8. Can review selected literature to develop a personal, scientifically informed perspective.


## Structure of thesis
The structure of the thesis can be determined in collaboration between student and supervisor. If unsure, the following structure is suggested:
1. Abstract
2. Introduction and definition of problem
3. Overview and critical discussion of studied literature
4. Personal critical opinion, ideally offered in interdisciplinary framework
5. Conclusions
6. References

## Topic
The research question of the Literature Thesis must be broad enough to justify spending 336 hours writing a paper on it (12 EC), but not so broad that the existing knowledge on the subject cannot be summarized in the time available. The supervisor is requested to justify this estimation when the choice of topic is finalized. Please note: the purpose of the Literature Thesis is NOT additional analysis of data from the literature.

Students may choose a topic in which they have a special interest within the field of brain and cognitive sciences. The content of the thesis should be distinct from the question addressed in their research project(s). Student and supervisor settle on the definitive subject for the paper together. 

Once the topic and time planning are decided on, the student uses the My Projects portal on Datanose to register the project. This gives the programme the opportunity to provide feedback on the topic choice, if this is deemed necessary. Once this thesis is approved, this becomes visible to the student on Datanose.

## Supervision
Besides the student, two persons are involved in the assessment of the Literature Thesis: a supervisor and an assessor. One of these two will in addition be designated examiner. A description of the roles and requirements is given in the below table.

|Role|Requirements|Responsibilities|Hours on project|
|---|---|----|:---:|
|Student||<ul><li>Defines problem or question.<li>Collects and analyzes literature.<li>Writes thesis.</ul>|336|
|Supervisor|<ul><li>Must be from discipline/research group different from co-assessor's</ul>|<ul><li>Guides the student through process of writing thesis.<li>Helps determine thesis topic.<li>Meets  with student *at least* three times.<li>Provides feedback on draft version.<li>Grades final work.</ul>|20|
|Assessor|<ul><li>Must hold a doctoral degree.<li>If the supervisor is a PhD candidate, must work at UvA.<li>Must be from discipline/research group different from co-assessor's</ul>|<ul><li>Grades final work.</ul>|4|

Please note that the UvA staff member who is designated examiner is responsible for determining and submitting the final grade. To do so, the examiner can log into www.datanose.nl using a link that will be sent via e-mail once the student submits the final version of the thesis online. The examiner can fill in the online grading form and submit the final grade.

The student and supervisor should meet at least three times during the course of the writing: (1) to discuss the outline of the thesis, (2) to discuss the first draft, and (3) to discuss the final version. The student is responsible for making these appointments with the supervisor. If reasonable, additional meetings are possible, but it should be kept in mind that supervisor should spend a total of 20 hours on supervision and that reading a draft version, providing feedback on the draft version and grading the final version are included in these 20 hours. The assessor has 4 hours to spend on co-assessment of the final work.

## Process
The follow steps determine the workflow of the Literature Thesis:
- Once there is an agreement between student, supervisor and assessor, the student can register the project via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects.
- The programme will then review whether the proposed set-up fits within the scope and regulations of *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.
- Once approved, work on the thesis can start.
- Upon completion, the student submits the thesis to datanose.nl.
- Once the thesis has been submitted, the examiner will receive a link via e-mail through which the final grade for the work can be registered. See [this section](#Grading) for more information on the grading process.

## Materials
The literature that is used to write the Literature Thesis is collected by the students themselves.

For those looking for more help with selecting or synthesizing sources, the following books may prove useful:
- Burger, A. A. (2008). *The Academic Writer’s Toolkit* (1st ed.). New York: Routledge. 
- Booth, W. C., Colomb, G. G., Williams, J. M., Bizup, J., & FitzGerald, W. T. (2016). *The Craft of Research* (4th ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

## Grading
The *Literature Thesis* is assessed by both the supervisor and assessor, both of whom are chosen by the student at the start of the project. The supervisor and assessor grade independently, with the final grade being the average of the two grades. To normalize grading, please use the grading rubric.

----
Please note: If a discrepancy of more than 1 point exists between grading by supervisor and co-assessor, the two should discuss their considerations with each other and seek consensus. If such consensus cannot be obtained, programme management should be contacted via info-mcs@uva.nl to reach a decision.

----

Once supervisor and assessor have graded the work, the following steps need to be taken:
1. The supervisor contacts the assessor to pick a date to discuss their assessment
2. If the two grades differ less than 1 point, the two grades are averaged
3. If the difference is bigger, supervisor and assessor motivate their stance and seek consensus
4. If such consensus cannot be obtained, the supervisor contacts info-mcs@uva.nl to report the issue. The programme will then review the case and determine the outcome
5. The supervisor and/or assessor discuss the final grade with the student and provide summative feedback.
6. Once a final grade is established, the examiner submits the grade to the online system at Datanose. An e-mail containing the link to this system is sent out automatically once the student submits the final version of the thesis.

After these steps, the grade is registered for and pushed through to the student.
Submitted grades are rounded to whole or half grades (exception: grade 5.5. is not allowed and should become 6.0 instead).

## Study load
The workload of the *Literature Thesis* should amount to 336 hours in total. The distribution of these hours will vary per project. The student prepares a detailed planning and time schedule from the outset of the thesis project. Student and supervisor should agree on this planning before an extensive literature search or the actual writing is started.

This planning involves:    
- the time needed for a literature search and preliminary reading of key references   
- the time needed for the actual writing of the thesis  
- the timing of intermediate steps—first draft, integrating feedback, final version

Please use your own judgment to determine word count or required amount of resources: different fields of study have different expectations. The following table can serve as a guideline for typical theses:

|Activity|Estimated hours|
|---|:---:|
|Finding appropriate supervision|1|
|Collecting review articles and identifying research question/problem statement|30|
|Collecting research papers|100|
|Organizing information|75|
|(Preparing) meetings/communication with supervisor|10|
|Writing draft|100|
|Writing final version|20|
|Total|336|

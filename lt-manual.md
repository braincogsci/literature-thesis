# Manual Literature Thesis Brain and Cognitive Sciences 2020-2021

## Introduction
The ability to review and synthesize information from a variety of sources is a key skill for academic researchers. The module *Literature Thesis Brain and Cognitive Sciences* is an opportunity for students to practice and develop the skills that are necessary to give a state-of-the-art overview of existing research, on a topic of the student’s choosing. The Literature Thesis should not reflect original research by the student (unless its research that the student already published it in a peer-reviewed journal), but instead collect, integrate and discuss existing work. 

## Learning objectives
Through the process of writing this thesis the student:
1. Demonstrates a scientific attitude (independence, time management & planning, scientific discussion, creativity, initiative, communication).
2. Demonstrates the ability to write in academic English.
3. Is able to find, select and organize relevant literature from scientific journals.
5. Can set out a framework to formulate a (literature research) question.
7. Is able to critically read and evaluate the selected literature.
8. Can review selected literature to develop a personal, scientifically informed perspective.
9. Can create an interdisciplinary perspective on a self-chosen thesis subject.

## Content
The final product created by the student should contain:

* A clear and motivated research question
* A comprehensive overview of the existing, relevant literature
* A critical discussion of the existing literature, leading to a clear position
* A section detailing how the conclusion of the thesis relates to other disciplines (i.e. how the outcome could contribute to other fields, or how other fields could provide a more complete answer to the research question).

## Size of thesis
All this should be done in eight weeks full time, or 336 hours. The way these hours are spent will differ per discipline and per project. Sometimes the collection of sources will be especially time-consuming, other times the interpretation or comparison of sources will be the lion's share of the work. The supervisor and the student should make sure there is a planning that reflects the time limit and should agree on a word count in advance.

The important thing is that the workload of the thesis equals eight weeks full-time, whether this time is spent on collecting resources, interpreting contradictory results or discussing the implications of the body of research.

For more information on assessment, see the [section on grading](#grading).

## Structure of thesis
The structure of the thesis can be determined in collaboration between student and supervisor. If unsure, the following structure is suggested:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction and definition of problem
3. Overview and critical discussion of studied literature
4. Personal critical opinion
5. Interdisciplinary reflection
6. Conclusions
7. References

## Topic
The research question of the *Literature Thesis* must be broad enough to justify spending 336 hours writing a paper on it (12 EC), but not so broad that the existing knowledge on the subject cannot be summarized in the time that is available. The supervisor is requested to justify this estimation when the choice of topic is finalized. Please note: the purpose of the Literature Thesis is NOT additional analysis of data from the literature.

Students may choose a topic in which they have a special interest within the field of brain and cognitive sciences. The content of the thesis should be distinct from the work the student performs in *Research Project 1* or *Research Project 2*. Student and supervisor settle on the definitive subject for the paper together, as part of the process of writing the Literature Thesis.

Once the topic and time planning are decided on, the student uses the Projects portal on Datanose (www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects) to register the project. This gives the programme the opportunity to provide feedback on the topic choice, if this is deemed necessary. It also allows the programme to confirm that supervision meets the standards set below.

## Supervision
Two separate persons are involved in the assessment of the Literature Thesis: an assessor and an examiner. One of these two will in addition be the supervisor of the thesis. A description of the roles and requirements is given in the below table. Note that the requirement for the examiner is that this person is a senior researcher at UvA, as the examiner ultimately holds responsibility for the validity of the grade. 

|Role|Requirements|Responsibilities|Expected hours on project|
|---|---|----|:---:|
|Student||<ul><li>Defines problem or question.<li>Collects and analyzes literature.<li>Writes thesis.</ul>|336|
|Supervisor||<ul><li>Guides the student through process of writing thesis.<li>Helps determine thesis topic.<li>Meets  with student *at least* three times during the writing process.<li>Provides feedback on draft version.<li>Grades final work.</ul>|20|
|Assessor|<ul><li>Must hold a doctoral degree.<li>Must be from discipline/research group different from assessor's</ul>|<ul><li>Grades final work.</ul>|20 if supervisor, otherwise 4|
|Examiner|<ul><li>Must hold a doctoral degree.<li>Must work at UvA.<li>Must be from discipline/research group different from examiner's</ul>| |20 if supervisor, otherwise 4|

Please note that the UvA staff member who is designated examiner is responsible for determining and submitting the final grade. To do so, the examiner can log into www.datanose.nl using a link that will be sent via e-mail once the student submits the final version of the thesis to the Project portal on Datanose.nl. The examiner can fill in the online grading form and submit the final grade.

The student and supervisor should meet at least three times during the course of the writing: (1) to discuss the outline of the thesis, (2) to discuss the first draft, and (3) to discuss the final version. The student is responsible for making these appointments with the supervisor. If reasonable, additional meetings are possible, but it should be kept in mind that supervisor is expected to spend about 20 hours on supervision and that reading a draft version, providing feedback on the draft version and grading the final version are included in these 20 hours. 

## Process
The following steps determine the workflow of the Literature Thesis:
- The student meets with a supervisor who has expertise on the topic of the student's interest. The student is not expected to do a lot of preparatory reading for this meeting, or have an exact research question ready, but should have some rough ideas about what to pursue. Deciding on the research question and doing preliminary reading is part of the *Literature Thesis* project.
- Once there is an agreement on the subject between student, supervisor and assessor, the student can register the project via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects. Here, the student can also submit who should be examiner of the project.
- The programme will then review whether the proposed set-up fits within the scope and regulations of *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.
- Once approved, the thesis can be included into the MBCS curriculum as a *Literature Thesis Brain and Cognitive Sciences (12 EC)*.
- During writing, the student meets with the supervisor at least three additional times to discuss progress.
- Before submitting a final version, the student may submit up to one draft version to the supervisor for feedback purposes.
- Upon completion, the student submits the thesis to datanose.nl.
- Once the thesis has been submitted, the examiner will receive a link via e-mail through which the final grade for the work can be registered. See [the section on grading](#grading) for more information on the grading process.

## Delays
In case the deadline for final submission as registered on Datanose is not going to be met by the student, the student is expected to contact the master's programme via info-mcs@uva.nl with an indication of the size of the delay. If the delay is more than one month, the student should also inform the study advisor of the programme and the examiner of the Literature Thesis. In this latter case, a motivation for the delay needs to be given. Based on this motivation, the examiner of the project may decide to set a new deadline together with the student or to mark the project as 'insufficient'.

## Materials and support
The literature that is used to write the Literature Thesis is collected by the students themselves.

Students looking for additional help with writing may wish to attend a workshop hosted by the [UvA Writing Centre](https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/studentensites/fgw/fgw-gedeelde-content/en/az/writing-centre/writing-centre.html).

## Grading
The *Literature Thesis* is assessed by the supervisor and assessor, both of whom are chosen by the student at the start of the project. Once the student has uploaded a final version of their literature thesis, the examiner and assessor will receive an e-mail message with a link to the Datanose project page, where they can submit partial grades for registration. The workflow for this is as follows:

1. Student uploads the final version to www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects
2. The examiner and asssessor will receive an e-mail notification to assess the thesis using an online grading rubric.
3. Once assessment is done, the examiner receives a message to confirm assessment. Before doing so, the examiner should check whether the final grade does not differ 1 grade point or more. If it does, the examiner should contact the assessor to discuss the discrepancy and seek more consensus. If such consensus cannot be reached, the examiner should contact the programme via info-mcs@uva.nl.
4. If a definitive grade has been decided on, the assessor and/or examiner meet with the student to provide summative feedback
5. After feedback has been given, the examiner can register the grade online via Datanose.

The supervisor and assessor grade independently and the average grade for each component is used to calculate the final grade for the thesis. To normalize grading, our dedicated grading rubric should be used. This grading rubric is also shown on Datanose when submitting the partial grades.

Upon confirmation of the final grade, the examiner will be prompted with a grade registration form, available for download as a PDF or for digital signing using two-factor authentication. If the examiner has not activated two-factor authentication, the programme can register the grade: printing the PDF, signing and scanning it and emailing it to info-mcs@uva.nl will allow the programme to do so. Also see the section [Submitting grades](https://github.com/braincogsci/teaching-matters/wiki/Submitting-grades) on our teaching wiki.

Note that upon confirmation of the grade (through digital signature or processing by the programme), the student is immediately informed about the end result. It is a best practice to ensure that the student has spoken with the supervisor about the assessment results before submitting grades to Datanose.

----
Please note: If a discrepancy of more than 1 point exists between grading by assessor and examiner, the two should discuss their considerations with each other and seek consensus. If such consensus cannot be obtained, programme management should be contacted via info-mcs@uva.nl to reach a decision. It is the responsibility of the examiner to assure that assessment is done in accordance with UvA standards.

----

Submitted grades are rounded to whole or half grades (exception: grade 5.5. is not allowed and should become 6.0 instead).

### Grade registration date
At the Faculty of Science of the University of Amsterdam, the grades for individual projects such as the *Literature Thesis* are registered with the date on which the examiner submitted the final grade. The student needs to be enrolled for such registration to be possible.

## Study load
The workload of the *Literature Thesis* should amount to 336 hours in total. The distribution of these hours will vary per project. The student prepares a detailed planning and time schedule from the outset of the thesis project. Student and supervisor should agree on this planning before an extensive literature search or the actual writing is started.

This planning involves:    
- the time needed for a literature search and preliminary reading of key references   
- the time needed for the actual writing of the thesis  
- the timing of intermediate steps—first draft, integrating feedback, final version

Please use your own judgment to determine word count or required amount of resources: different fields of study have different expectations. The following table can serve as a guideline for typical theses:

|Activity|Estimated hours|
|---|:---:|
|Finding appropriate supervision|1|
|Collecting review articles and identifying research question/problem statement|30|
|Collecting research papers|100|
|Organizing information|75|
|(Preparing) meetings/communication with supervisor|10|
|Writing draft|100|
|Writing final version|20|
|Total|336|

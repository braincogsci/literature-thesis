Student did not take a very proactive role in working on the project and solving problems.|The student submitted draft and final work in time and took a proactive stance towards work that needed to be done and problems that needed to be solved.|The student submitted draft and final work in time and was very proactive during the whole process of creating the thesis, foreseeing issues and possible solutions and acting accordingly to solve them ahead of time. |
|Abstract (5%)|The final paper does not include an abstract.|The final paper includes an abstract with some of the elements of the paper listed.|The final paper includes an abstract that clearly conveys the topic of the thesis and key findings discussed in the thesis.|The final paper includes an abstract that clearly conveys the topic of the thesis and summarizes multiple perspectives.|The final paper includes an abstract that clearly conveys the topic of the thesis and summarizes multiple perspectives, as well as a critical reflection on these perspectives.|
|Writing (10%) |The grammar and/or spelling in the thesis are poor, or the review lacks clarity and logical flow.|The text is organized acceptably, but many small issues (either spelling, grammar or flow) hinder clarity.|The final paper is organized acceptably, with logical flows and transitions and headings that ease comprehension of the text. Spelling and grammar are of good quality.|The final paper is very well organized. The writing is clear, parsimonious and makes good use of logical flow. Headings are helpful and used consistently.|The final paper is very well organized. The writing is clear, parsimonious and makes good use of logical flow. Headings are helpful and used consistently. Thoughts are articulated very well, leading to highly effective communication.|
|Theoretical framework and problem statement (30%)|There is no clear description of the problem that the thesis tries to address, or context is lacking tounderstand the relevance and/or key concepts that are to be explored.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly, but the discussion of background literature to contextualize the problem or operational definitions of key concept are lacking, incomplete or inaccurate.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly and key concepts from the background literature and operational definitions are reviewed to clarify the problem.|The problem that the thesis tries to address is defined clearly, operational definitions are given and the student has integrated a variety of sources to properly contextualize said problem.|The student has not only given clear operational definitions and an integrated theoretical framework that draws on a variety of sources, but also identified an important problem that warrants the literature research.|
|Critical thinking (20%)|The student uncritically summarizes existing literature and/or takes a singular perspective on the topic of the thesis, without addressing the assumptions underlying the cited research.|The student critically addresses some research findings, but only minimally examines underlying assumptions and mostly takes a singular perspective.|The student critically addresses some of the research findings and examines underlying assumptions, while comparing multiple perspectives on the topic at hand.|The student critically addresses the research body under examination and takes a clear position by comparing multiple perspectives and questioning underlying assumptions.|The student shifts the thinking of the reader by critically examining the existing literature and taking a well-reasoned stance, based on a comparison between multiple perspectives. This student questions underlying assumptions and adds original thought.|
|Content and discussion (20%)|The student does not present data/information in a clear manner, is incomplete/inaccurate when interpreting existing research or incoherent in drawing conclusions.|The student sets out a coherent line of thought, based on accurate interpretations of existing literature, but leaves out relevant findings.|The student sets out a coherent line of thought and accurately interprets existing literature, while covering most of the relevant findings. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework.|The student sets out a coherent line of thought and interprets existing research accurately, while clearly showing the connections between them to make an argument. No relevant findings are missing, nor are irrelevant findings discussed. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework.|The student sets out a coherent line of thought and interprets existing research accurately, while clearly showing the connections between them to make an argument. No relevant findings are missing, nor are irrelevant findings discussed. The discussion addresses the problem statement of the thesis and adds to the theoretical framework, while also making clear suggestions for future, follow-up research.|
